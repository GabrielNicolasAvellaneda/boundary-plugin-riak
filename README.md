### Plugin Setup

Before the plugin will collect metrics, you must provide it with the URL used to access the Riak stats endpoint.  By default, this is "http://127.0.0.1:8098/stats", but it could be different if you have configured a different port.

### Plugin Configuration Fields

|Field Name    |Description                         |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------------|
|Riak Stats URL|The URL to Riak's stats API endpoint|
|Poll Interval | How often (in milliseconds) to poll for metrics |
|Source     |The Source to display in the legend for the metrics data.  It will default to the hostname of the server|
